/**
 * An inline class must have a single property initialized in the primary constructor.
 * At runtime, instances of the inline class will be represented using this single property.
 *
 * inline classes cannot have init blocks
 * inline class properties cannot have backing fields
 * inline classes can only have simple computable properties (no lateinit/delegated properties)
 *
 * Inline classes are available only since Kotlin 1.3 and currently experimental.
